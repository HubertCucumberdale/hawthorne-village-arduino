I'm not going to do the addressable thing, the lights need to be individual LEDs, because they need to poke out through holes in the house's structure, but it seems like I only have a few regions:
1. Outer string lights (12 lights) -- parallel wiring
2. Child's Room 1 (1 light)
3. Child's Room 2 (1 light)
4. Child's Room 3 (1 light)
5. Family Room (2 lights) -- parallel wiring
6. Sitting Room (1 light)
7. Dining Room (1 lights)
8. Bed Room (1 light)
9. Upstairs Hallway (1 light)
10. Attic (1 light)

What equipment do I need to drive these.
The outer string lights are 3mm leds
All interior lights are 5mm (width and height) with a square top rather than a domed top.
